Generate a professional, structured Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) document in full compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nThis ROPA document must be suitable for official regulatory review and written in formal business language.\n\nInstructions:\n- Create a comprehensive ROPA document structure with the following sections:\n1. Organization and Controller Information\n2. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing\n3. Data Categories and Sources\n4. Data Subjects and Recipients\n5. Data Retention and Deletion\n6. Technical and Organizational Measures\n- Each category can have a continous text and bullet points as needed.\n- Ensure compliance with GDPR Articles 30 (Records of processing activities) requirements.\n- Respect the Additional Information and Special Instructions provided.\n- You must include all data given, and must not omit any data provided.\n\nThe output should be suitable for use by a Data Protection Officer (DPO) or legal counsel.\nThe output should be in .md style with proper headings and formatting. You must only include data categories marked as true and must not include data categories marked as false. Omit wording or phrasing such as CATEGORY: true/false, but rather just include the relevant, true data categories. Critical Instructions:\n\nInclude all provided information in your response - do not omit any items from the list unless \"false\" or empty.\nHandle \"other\" field: If an \"other\" field exists and contains data, treat it as a standard list item with equal importance. Do not use \"other\" as a label.\nFormatting requirement: Present items as a simple list within each category. Do NOT use the format \"data_category: description\" - instead, list items directly without labeling the data structure.\n\nExample: \n\n### 4. Data Subjects and Recipients\n- Person Categories:\n    - Employees\n    - USER INPUT\n    \nNOT LIKE THIS:\n\n### 4. Data Subjects and Recipients\n- Person Categories: \n  - Employees\n  - Other: yo mama",
