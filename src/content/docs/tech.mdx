## Infrastructure & Deployment

### Version Control & Repository Management

ROPAgen is hosted on **[GitHub](https://github.com/ganglem/ropagen)**, following modern Git workflows and repository management practices. The project utilizes GitHub's comprehensive toolset for collaborative development:

- **Issue Tracking**: Feature requests and bug reports managed through GitHub Issues
- **Feature Branches**: Development follows a feature branch workflow into `dev` for testing
- **Branch Strategy**: `dev` → `main` promotion workflow for stable releases
- **Version Tags**: Semantic versioning with Git tags for release management
- **Milestones**: Project planning and release coordination through GitHub Milestones
- **Pull Requests**: Code review process ensuring quality and consistency

### Automated Git-to-Production Pipeline

The deployment architecture implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that transforms git commits into live deployments without manual intervention.

**Git Workflow**
The deployment process follows a branch-based strategy:

1. **Development Branch**: Commits to `dev` branch trigger automatic deployment to `dev.ropagen.eu`
2. **Main Branch**: Commits to `main` branch trigger automatic deployment to `ropagen.eu`
3. **Container Registry**: Each branch builds and pushes to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with appropriate tags

**Automated Build Process**
When code is pushed to either branch, the following automated sequence occurs:

```bash
# 1. GitHub Actions (or similar CI) detects push
git push origin main  # or dev

# 2. Automated Docker build process
docker build -t ganglem/ropagen:latest .        # for main branch
docker build -t ganglem/ropagen-dev:latest .    # for dev branch

# 3. Push to Docker Hub registry
docker push ganglem/ropagen:latest              # production image
docker push ganglem/ropagen-dev:latest          # development image

# 4. Watchtower detects new image and triggers deployment
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow**
The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions with the following workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: Autodeploy MAIN

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ganglem/ropagen:latest
```

This workflow automatically triggers on every push to the `main` branch, building a new Docker image and pushing it to Docker Hub with the `latest` tag. A similar workflow exists for the `dev` branch targeting the `ganglem/ropagen-dev:latest` image.

### Multi-Environment Docker Compose Configuration

The server runs both production and development environments simultaneously using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
services:
  # Production Environment
  app:
    container_name: ganglem-ropagen
    image: ganglem/ropagen:latest
    env_file: .env
    networks: [web]
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.rule=Host(`ropagen.eu`)
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.tls.certresolver=lets-encrypt
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.middlewares=auth
      - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true

  # Development Environment
  dev:
    container_name: ganglem-ropagen-dev
    image: ganglem/ropagen-dev:latest
    env_file: .env
    networks: [web]
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen-dev.rule=Host(`dev.ropagen.eu`)
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen-dev.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen-dev.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen-dev.tls.certresolver=lets-encrypt
      - traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen-dev.middlewares=dev-auth
      - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true

networks:
  web:
    external: true
```

### Deployment Features

**Automated Git-to-Production Pipeline**
- **Development**: `dev.ropagen.eu` (dev branch)
- **Production**: `ropagen.eu` (main branch)
- [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) monitors Docker Hub every 30 seconds for updates
- Zero-downtime deployments with graceful container restarts

**Security & SSL**
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) automatic SSL certificate management
- Basic authentication protection for controlled access
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy with automatic service discovery
- Environment isolation through Docker networks

### Watchtower Auto-Deployment Mechanism

**Watchtower Configuration**
The server runs [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) as a separate container that monitors Docker Hub for image updates:

```yaml
# Watchtower service (typically in separate compose file)
watchtower:
  image: containrrr/watchtower
  container_name: watchtower
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - /root/.docker/config.json:/config.json
  command: --interval 30 --cleanup
  restart: unless-stopped
```

**Deployment Flow**
The complete deployment sequence works as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Git Push] --> B[CI/CD Build]
    B --> C[Docker Push]
    C --> D[Watchtower Detection]
    D --> E[Container Pull]
    E --> F[Rolling Update]
    F --> G[Live Deployment]
```

1. **Push Detection**: Developer pushes to `main` or `dev` branch
2. **Automated Build**: CI system builds new Docker image with latest code
3. **Registry Update**: New image pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with appropriate tag
4. **Watchtower Polling**: [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) checks for updates every 30 seconds
5. **Image Pull**: Downloads new image version automatically
6. **Rolling Update**: Stops old container, starts new one with zero downtime
7. **Health Check**: [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) verifies new container is responding correctly

### Multi-Environment Deployment

**Production Environment**
- **Domain**: `ropagen.eu`
- **Container**: `ganglem/ropagen:latest`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Authentication**: Basic auth protection for controlled access
- **SSL**: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate management
- **Update Trigger**: Push to main branch

**Development Environment**
- **Domain**: `dev.ropagen.eu`
- **Container**: `ganglem/ropagen-dev:latest`
- **Branch**: `dev`
- **Staging**: Full feature testing before production deployment
- **Update Trigger**: Push to dev branch

### Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing

**Traefik Configuration**
The infrastructure utilizes [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) with Docker provider for automatic service discovery:

```yaml
# Traefik labels decode to:
# - Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
# - Host-based routing (ropagen.eu vs dev.ropagen.eu)
# - Basic authentication middleware
# - Docker network integration
# - Health checking capabilities
```

**SSL Certificate Management**
```bash
# Automatic certificate provisioning
traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.tls.certresolver=lets-encrypt

# Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect
traefik.http.routers.ganglem-ropagen.entrypoints=websecure
```

### Automated Deployment Pipeline

**Zero-Downtime Deployment Process**

```bash
# 1. Developer workflow
git add .
git commit -m "feature: new functionality"
git push origin main  # triggers production deployment

# 2. Automated server-side process (no manual intervention)
# Watchtower detects new image
# Pulls ganglem/ropagen:latest
# Gracefully stops old container
# Starts new container with updated code
# Traefik automatically routes traffic to new container

# 3. Verification
curl https://ropagen.eu  # new version live
```

**Environment-Specific Configuration**
Each environment maintains separate configuration through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) labels and environment files:

```bash
# Production deployment command (automated)
docker-compose up -d app

# Development deployment command (automated)
docker-compose up -d dev

# Both environments can run simultaneously on the same server
# Traefik routes traffic based on domain (ropagen.eu vs dev.ropagen.eu)
```

**Security & Access Control**
- Basic authentication with [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)-hashed credentials
- Network isolation through Docker networks
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
