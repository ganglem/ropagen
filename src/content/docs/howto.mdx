---

The ROPA Generator helps you create professional Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) documents required by GDPR Article 30. This guide shows you how to navigate the website and generate compliant documentation.

## Your Workflow Options

### Option 1: Start with a Template
Select from pre-built templates that automatically populate your form with common data processing scenarios. Templates are available for HR management, customer relations, and marketing activities.

### Option 2: Fill Out Form Directly
Skip templates and build your ROPA from scratch by filling out each section manually.

## Navigating the Form

### Organization Details
Enter your company information, contact details, and Data Protection Officer information. These details appear in every generated document.

### Purpose and Legal Basis
Describe why you process personal data and select the applicable GDPR legal grounds. Be specific about your business objectives.

### Data Categories and Sources
Choose what types of personal data you process and where it comes from. The form includes comprehensive categories from basic contact information to specialized business data.

### Adding Custom Data
In any text field, you can add specific details relevant to your organization. The "Additional Information" section lets you include custom requirements or special processing conditions.

### Technical Measures
Describe your security practices and data protection measures. This becomes a key section in your ROPA document.

## Choose Your AI Model

Select from available language models:

**GPT-4o**: Most comprehensive outputs with detailed GDPR compliance
**GPT-4.1**: Alternative OpenAI model for varied writing styles
**Mistral**: European AI provider for data sovereignty requirements

## How the AI Generation Works

When you click generate, the application transforms your form data into a structured prompt for the AI model.

### The Prompt Construction Code

```typescript
function generatePromptFromData(documentData: DocumentData, locale: string): string {
    // Convert form selections to readable text
    const selectedDataSources = Object.entries(documentData.categories.dataSources)
        .filter(([key, value]) => value === true || (typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() !== ''))
        .map(([key, value]) => `- ${key.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').trim()}`)
        .join('\n');

    // Organize data categories hierarchically
    const selectedDataCategories = Object.entries(documentData.categories.dataCategories)
        .map(([categoryKey, categoryData]) => {
            const selectedItems = Object.entries(categoryData)
                .filter(([_, isSelected]) => isSelected)
                .map(([subKey]) => `  - ${subKey.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').trim()}`)
                .join('\n');

            return selectedItems ? `${categoryKey}:\n${selectedItems}` : null;
        })
        .filter(Boolean)
        .join('\n\n');

    // Build the complete prompt
    return `You are a GDPR compliance expert. Generate a professional ROPA document...`;
}
```

### The AI Prompt Structure

### How It Works

The code automatically converts your form selections into readable text, filters out empty fields, and organizes everything into a structured prompt. The AI then generates a professional ROPA document following GDPR Article 30 requirements.

The system handles fallbacks for missing information and ensures all provided data appears in the final document.

## Export Your Document

Once generated, export your ROPA in multiple formats: PDF for official use, Markdown for editing, or plain text for maximum compatibility.

The ROPA Generator streamlines GDPR compliance by transforming complex form data into professional documentation through sophisticated AI prompting and processing.
